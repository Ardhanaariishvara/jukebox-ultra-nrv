## Security

The current use of this application is only among a "friendly" and local network.
As such, we haven't yet focused much on security.
The passwords are stored using pbkdf2_sha256 from library `passlib`.

## Troubleshooting

If you are using a systemctl service.
Check if the service is properly running :
 `$ sudo systemctl status jukebox`
 
Check the logs :
 `$ sudo journalctl -u jukebox.service`
 
Check if youtube-dl is working and up to date
 `youtube-dl https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xKWiCMKKJg`

If not, update it : `sudo youtube-dl -U`


## Development

For the logs, please use `app.logger.info`, `app.logger.warning` or `app.logger.error`.
